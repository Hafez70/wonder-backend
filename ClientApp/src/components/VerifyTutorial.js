            <h3>Welcome to activation Guide!</h3>
            <p>Why do we need activation?</p>
            <p>In the real world, when a person pays for a tool he buys, he is naturally not satisfied that someone uses his personal device without his permission, which is tantamount to stealing.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, the development team has spent a lot of time and energy to build its products, so it is our natural right that only the real customer who bought the products can use our products.</p>
            <p>And consider that ,it is a newborn product, you may see small errors at first, no one was perfect at the begining but with your feedback and advises we will grow and make sure that our tools are making customers satisfy
                and remember that our support team is always happy to help you.</p>
            <br/>
            <h5><strong>1. Envato Authentication:</strong></h5>
            <p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
            <p>Since we publish our Wonder Tools exclusively in Envato Market and no wjere else, we need to ensure that you bought the Tools from Invato and not the other markets.</p>
            <p><strong>Will our Envato account be safe?</strong></p>
            <p>absolutely, in authentication phase we will link you to Envato Api and the next steps will happen in their enviroment, after the authentcity accepted from Envato side, they will pass us the token that means you are the true customer and we can trust you.</p>
            <p><strong>What is the approval section in Envato?</strong></p>
            <p>"View your email address" and "View your Envato Account username" : We will request envato with this permission to get your envato e-mail address and make ensure that the E-mail address you give us is for the one who truly bought the product from Envato market.</p>
            <p>"List purchases you've made" and "Verify purchases you've made" : It will show us the list of products you purchased just from us, it will show only products you bought specialy from Wonder Tools and nothing more, it will help us to know your purchase code is true and trustable.</p>
            <p><strong>What is Next?</strong></p>
            <p>After that you will link back here to complete activation.</p>
            <br />
            <h5><strong>2. Wonder Tools activation Code:</strong></h5>
            <p>After Envato give us the green sign that you are the trustable one you will see two inputs that you should fill them up</p>
            <p><strong>Purchase Code:</strong></p>
            <p>This code is the one that Envato Market sent to your email after successful purchase and it is unique per purchase.</p>
            <p>It is important to know that you can just activate the extension ONLY for two unique machines.</p>
            <p><strong>What is unique machines  means ?</strong></p>
            <p>A Unique machine is a computer with specific adobe application version it meas that for example if you have two version of after effects installed on your computer (like 2021 and 2017 versions) you need a unique activation code for each.</p>
            <p>If you need to install the extension on a 'new version of after effect' or in 'new computer' that you bought recently or with the new 'computer username' you need to get new activation code and disable one of the last used seasions you activated before.</p>
            <p>If you want to use the product on more seasions, you need to buy the product again and get the new purchase code for activation.</p>
            <p>It is posible that you email get hacked by scammers and hackers or some one , somehow find your purchase code the should pass the Envato authentication phase to get Wonder tools activation code, so it is nearly imposible to steal your extension</p>
            <p>But if some one has your e-mail address, your purchase code and your envato authentication information we assume that it is You.</p>
            <p><strong>E-mail address</strong></p>
            <p>This is THE e-mail address that you registered in Envato market and not any other random e-mail addresses you might have.</p>
            <br />
            <h5><strong>3. Get Activation Code :</strong></h5>
            <p>This is the title of the button you should clicke on it to get the activation code</p>
            <p>after we validation your information in few seconds the activation code will apear on the screen you are responsible to keep is safe and you can activate ONLY one seasion with it</p>
            <p>You can find your currently active seasions in list below the result of activation, if you need to deactivate one of them or you see some seasion are suspicios you can easily remove the seasion by 'Deactivate!' button in there</p>
            <h5><strong>3. Copy and Paste the activation code :</strong></h5>
            <p>Simply copy the whole code in the section and pase it in your extension to activate it and enjoy!</p>
            <h5><strong>IMPORTANT!</strong></h5>
            <p>The Extension checks its activation validity with the server every time you enter it, so make sure that internet connection is good and your fire-wall would not prevent the request action.
                if somehow you lost your internet connection access the extension will allow you to use it, but afte several failure cheks it will deactivate itself and you need to get new activation code with steps that explained above.</p>
